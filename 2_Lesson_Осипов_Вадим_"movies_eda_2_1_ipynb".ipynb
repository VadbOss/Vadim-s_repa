Круговой график также малоинформативен ввиду большого количества значений признака. Топ5 показывает только одного лидера, остальные находятся в равновеликом положении. Графики малоинформативны в данном случае, более показательны аналитические показатели (value_counts, unique, сортировка этих показателей)."
